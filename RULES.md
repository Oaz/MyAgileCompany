## Game Content
The game consists of 109 cards:
* A card with 12 squares numbered 1 to 12 which allows counting the rounds of the game.
* A "Game Leader" card that changes hands at each round.
* 5 "Activity" cards showing the activities that can be performed during each round.
* 4 "Earnings" cards showing the earnings made during a software deployment.
* 31 "Product Team" cards
* 54 "Agile Maturity" cards representing agile practices.
* 13 "Agile Value" cards

## Setting up the game
The game is played in 2, 3 or 4 groups, each group consisting of 1, 2 or 3 people.

Each group is a different video game company.

The 12-boxes card is placed in the center of the table with a token on the "1" box to indicate that you are in the first round.

The 5 "Activity" cards are also placed face up in the center of the table so that all players can access them.

The cards "Earnings" form a stack, face down.

Each group receives an ADVERGAME "Team Product" card and places it in front of him on the table.
This card is the initial state of the company: a unique product team that that creates advertising games.

The other cards "Team Product", "Agile Maturity" and "Agile Value" are grouped together and mixed to form a unique game pick. Each group draws 4 of these cards and keeps them in hand.

One of the groups is randomly assigned and receives the card "Game Leader".

## Goal of the game
The winning group is the one who, after the 12 rounds, has constituted the company with the most points.
The company is made up of all the cards put together and the points are added.

## Unfolding a tour
The group with the "Game Leader" card chooses an activity.
He takes the corresponding card and lays it in front of him.
All groups will, in turn, perform the chosen activity starting with the group that has chosen the activity.

The next group then selects one activity from the remaining four activities and again all groups will perform the chosen activity in turn, starting with the group that chose the activity.

The choice of an activity and its execution continue until each group has chosen an activity.

## Conduct of an activity
The activities are described on each card:
* DEVELOPMENT: each company has the possibility to develop a product (and only one). To materialize this development, the group uses one of the cards it has in hand and poses, face down, on one of the product teams of its company. The group that is at the initiative of this activity has the possibility to execute 2 times this action on 2 different product teams. If a product team already has a developed product, it can not develop a second product until the first one is deployed. 
* DEPLOYMENT: the card at the top of the stack of "Earnings" is returned. Each company has the possibility to deploy a product (and only one). The card corresponding to the deployed product is discarded and the group draws the number of cards indicated by the earnings card according to the product team that has deployed. The group that is at the initiative of the activity has the possibility to execute 2 times this action with 2 different product teams. When all groups have completed the activity, the earnings card returns to the end of the stack.
* RETROSPECTIVE: Each group has the opportunity to improve their business by setting up a new product team or an agile practice or value. To do this, the group places one of the cards in its hands and discards the number of cards corresponding to the cost of the card. For the group that initiates the activity, the cost is reduced by one card to be discarded. Each practice or value can only be set up once. The number of similar product teams is not limited.
* CONFERENCE: Each group increases its playing capacity by going to a conference. Each group draws two cards and keeps one. The other is discarded. The group that initiated the activity draws 5 cards and discards 4.
* COACH: The group that chooses this activity is the only one to benefit from the intervention of a coach and draw a card. 

## End of Round
When all groups have selected their activity and the selected activities have been completed, the round is over. The token moves to the next box. The "Game Leader" card goes to the next group. All groups keep a maximum of 6 cards in hand and discard the cards they have in excess. 

## End of the game
At the end of the twelfth round, each group sums up the points of its company and the winner is designated.

## Impact of agile practices and values
Each agile practice implemented in a company following a retrospective has an influence on the progress of the activities and / or the counting of the score. For example, implementing the "Clean Code" allows the group to carry out twice the development action of a product instead of one in the corresponding activity (or even three times instead of two if the group is at the origin of the activity). Each practice can only be set up once in the company, but its influence is permanent once it has been set up.

Each value adopted by a company has an impact on the end of the round (the possibility to keep an extra card beyond the six by adopted value) and on the final score (1 point if 1 value has been adopted, 4 points if 2 values were adopted, 9 points for 3 values, 16 points for 4 values, 25 points for 5 values, etc.)
